    "Guard abilities allow you to reduce the base damage of incoming attacks for a turn. If an attack's base damage is lowered below 0, it will deal no damage.\n\nYour opponent is going to use an ability that scales off of their atk stat and has a base damage of 30. Click the 'Non-ability Actions' dropdown and select 'View Fighter' to determine what ability you should use in order to survive their attack.",
